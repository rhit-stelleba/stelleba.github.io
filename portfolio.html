      <ul id="portfolioItems">
        <li>
          <h2><a href="#">Luminesce</a></h2>
          <img src="images/projects/luminesce_screenshot.png" alt="A screenshot of the Luminesce game I made" />
          <p>A retro game / endless platformer I created. Enemies used AI and I created infinite random generation of the playing space as well as my own physics engine.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2><a href="#">Autobalancing AVL Tree</a></h2>
          <img src="images/projects/autobalancingAVLTREE.png" alt="A diagram showing rotation of nodes in an AVL tree" />
          <p>Binary Search Trees with the balanced property, except for upon deletion or insertion, these will automatically re-balance themselves. In doing so, they also maintain the order of elements, allowing for log(N) searches.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2><a href="#">Red Cloud</a></h2>
          <img src="images/projects/redCloud.png" alt="A screenshot of the Red Cloud game I made" />
          <p>Utilizing my knowledge of masking in art (such as with photoshop), I made a game called red cloud with special vfx. The game was an endless survival game, in which you could combo enemies with a sword and take the shape of a red, high-damage "cloud" for a brief time. Enemies could also take such a form upon death, but would be green and upon collapsing would take away a percentage of the player's health depending on the percent overlapped by their cloud on the player's.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2><a href="#">CSS VFX</a></h2>
          <img src="images/projects/css_vfx.jpg" alt="Screenshot of some visual effects and crazy experiments I've done with CSS" />
          <p>I often like to mess around with CSS and other languages to create interesting visual effects and animations. This showcases some freezframes of some "spinner" objects I have made with pure CSS.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2><a href="#">Melodies & Music</a></h2>
          <img src="images/projects/guitar.png" alt="Outline of me playing guitar" />
          <p>In my free time I come up with melodies on guitar and other tracks that could be used as simple soundtracks in games.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2><a href="#">Photoshop</a></h2>
          <img src="images/projects/out_of_place.jpg" alt="Picture of a highly-edited frog" />
          <p>As mentioned with CSS vfx, I have gotten quite familiar with photoshop and other similar photo-editing softwares. I use it to create art for a variety of things and to sometimes just create.</p>
