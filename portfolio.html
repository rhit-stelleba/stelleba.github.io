          <h2><a href="#">Luminesce</a></h2>
          <img src="images/projects/luminesce_screenshot.png" alt="A screenshot of the Luminesce game I made" />
          <p>A retro game / endless platformer I created. Enemies used AI and I created infinite random generation of the playing space as well as my own physics engine.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2><a href="#">Autobalancing AVL Tree</a></h2>
          <img src="images/projects/autobalancingAVLTREE.png" alt="A diagram showing rotation of nodes in an AVL tree" />
          <p>Binary Search Trees with the balanced property, except for upon deletion or insertion, these will automatically re-balance themselves. In doing so, they also maintain the order of elements, allowing for log(N) searches.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2><a href="#">Red Cloud</a></h2>
          <img src="images/projects/redCloud.png" alt="A screenshot of the Red Cloud game I made" />
          <p>Utilizing my knowledge of masking in art (such as with photoshop), I made a game called red cloud with special vfx. The game was an endless survival game, in which you could combo enemies with a sword and take the shape of a red, high-damage "cloud" for a brief time. Enemies could also take such a form upon death, but would be green and upon collapsing would take away a percentage of the player's health depending on the percent overlapped by their cloud on the player's.</p>
